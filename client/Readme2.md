# PE01 - Resume Web App

## Input
The resume app does not take external input. All the resume data (name, contact info, education, etc.) is hard-coded inside `Resume.js`.

## Process
The app renders the resume using a React functional component styled via CSS. React's JSX syntax is used to structure content, while the CSS ensures consistent styling and layout.

## Output
The final output is a visually structured resume displayed in the browser with a custom green background (`#bdfb04`) and black text. It includes personal, educational, technical, and professional details.
